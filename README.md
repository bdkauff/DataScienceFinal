DataScienceFinal
================
This is the final project for my course Data Science Storytelling. It was a 7 week course on data analysis with iPython Notebook.

I analyzed geography and provenance in the sample of collections data from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There is also a pretty PDF that I created for final presentation.
